# FastAPI-Base
A scalable and maintainable FastAPI project template with clear separation of concerns. Includes models, routes, services, and more. Easily extendable for various applications. Includes Docker support, environment configurations, and unit tests for efficient development and deployment.

### **Project Structure Review**
1. **`app/` Directory**:
   - **`main.py`**: Entry point for the FastAPI app. This is where the `FastAPI` instance is created and routers are included.
   - **`models/`**: Contains Pydantic models and database models. This separation is good for clarity.
   - **`api/`**: Contains route handlers (endpoints). Splitting routes into separate files (`users.py`, `products.py`) is a good practice for scalability.
   - **`services/`**: Business logic layer. This is a great way to separate concerns and keep your routes clean.
   - **`core/`**: Configuration and utility functions. This is a good place for settings, security, and other shared functionality.
   - **`db/`**: Database-related files (e.g., session handling, ORM models). This is well-organized.
   - **`schemas/`**: Pydantic schemas for data validation. This is a good practice for ensuring data integrity.

2. **Root Files**:
   - **`requirements.txt`**: Lists dependencies. Ensure this is up-to-date.
   - **`alembic.ini`**: Configuration for Alembic (database migrations). Good for managing database schema changes.
   - **`Dockerfile`**: For containerization. Useful for deployment.
   - **`.env`**: Environment variables. Make sure this file is included in `.gitignore` to avoid exposing sensitive data.
   - **`README.md`**: Documentation. Ensure it’s clear and up-to-date.

3. **`tests/` Directory**:
   - Contains unit and integration tests. This is excellent for maintaining code quality.

### **Code Review**

Your `main.py` file looks good. Here’s a quick breakdown:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from app.api import users, products

app = FastAPI()

# Include user and product routers
app.include_router(users.router, prefix="/users", tags=["users"])
app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/products", tags=["products"])
```

- **`FastAPI()`**: Creates the FastAPI app instance.
- **`include_router()`**: Includes the routers from `users.py` and `products.py` with appropriate prefixes and tags. This is a clean way to organize routes.

### **Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Environment Configuration**:

   - Consider using `pydantic-settings` or `python-decouple` for managing environment variables instead of directly using `.env`. This provides better type safety and validation.
2. **Dependency Injection**:

   - Use FastAPI’s dependency injection system to manage dependencies (e.g., database sessions, services) instead of directly importing them in your routes.
3. **Error Handling**:

   - Add a global exception handler in `main.py` to handle common exceptions (e.g., `HTTPException`, validation errors).
4. **Testing**:

   - Ensure your tests cover edge cases and error scenarios. Consider using `pytest` with `httpx` for testing FastAPI endpoints.
5. **Logging**:

   - Add logging to your application for better debugging and monitoring.
6. **API Documentation**:

   - Customize the OpenAPI documentation (e.g., add descriptions, examples) to make it more user-friendly.

### **Example of Dependency Injection**

Here’s how you can use dependency injection for database sessions:

```python
# app/db/session.py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./test.db"  # Replace with your actual DB URL
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()
```

```python
# app/api/users.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session### **Project Structure Review**

### **Example of Global Exception Handling**

```python
# app/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.exception_handler(HTTPException)
async def http_exception_handler(request, exc):
    return JSONResponse(status_code=exc.status_code, content={"detail": exc.detail})

@app.exception_handler(RequestValidationError)
async def validation_exception_handler(request, exc):
    return JSONResponse(status_code=422, content={"detail": exc.errors()})
```
